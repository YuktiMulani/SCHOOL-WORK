This  workshop taught me that moving operation is faster than copying.The move assignment 
operator takes an r-value reference only.Moving enables you to leave the source in an incorrect 
state so you can take its resources, making it faster. For instance, a move can simply steal a 
pointer to a big block of allocated memory held by an object, whereas a copy needs to allocate 
its own memory and copy the entire memory block.

In this workshop I used the getline function of fstream to read the input file with the 
deliminator as ',' because csv means coma separated file. In my opinion we can avoid rereading 
the file my storing all its data in an array and then scanning the array instead of rereading 
the file itself.

the difference between steady_clock and a system_clock is that when a system clock is in your hand, 
you would refer to it as a watch, and it would display the current time. If you were holding a steady 
clock in your hand, you would refer to it as a stopwatch since it would show you how quickly someone 
completed a lap but not the current time.when we want to access the current time we should use the 
system_clock and when we want to set a timer we can use a steady_clock.
