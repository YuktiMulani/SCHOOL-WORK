The following are the types i have chosen for the identifiers in the reservation module.
reservation id - string beacause this conatins mix data including numbers and letters too.
name-string because all the names are strings basically.
email-string because email also contains a mix of characters.
no of people - size_t, day-size_t,hours-size_t because we wanted to return the size of the object in bytes.



An association between two datasets, such as classes or objects, known as a "aggregation," occurs
 when the concerned objects do not directly depend on one another for either their production or 
operation. Therefore, the status of the other object is unaffected by the manipulation of the first 
object. Changes can be made with this association without suffering any loss.

The relationship between two datasets in which the objects or classes are directly dependent on one 
other for their generation, storage, operation, etc. is described by a special sort of aggregation 
called composition. As a result, any change to one of the databases will immediately affect the other 
dataset.
