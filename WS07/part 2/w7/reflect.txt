	I have done all the coding by myself and
	only copied the code that my professor provided
	to complete my workshops and assignments.
*******************/

I learned the following topics from this workshop:

Use the numeric library to accumulate data values,
use a lambda expression to specify an operation on 
each value in a data set, use the algorithm library 
to sort data values and copy data from a file into a sequential container.

The notes provided to us and lecture made the workshop smooth to work with.
I have used the following library functions in the workshop:-
1.substr()
2.erase()
3.remove()
4.is_open()
5.begin()
6.end()
7.stoi()
8.pushback()
9.peek()
10.setstate()
11.for_each()
12.accumalate()
13.sort()
14.transform()
15.count_if()
16.copy_if()
