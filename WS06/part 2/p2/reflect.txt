In the workshop I leaqrned the following content.I have also done the workshop by my own.

-manage polymorphic objects using the vector container of the STL

-move a dynamically allocated object into a container

-code a range-based iteration on the objects in a container

-report and handle an exception

There were some errors in the workshop but I referred to the notes provided to us and after that i was able to debug the problems.
